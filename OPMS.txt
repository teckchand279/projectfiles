Introduction:
The purpose of this document is to outline the requirements for the development of a Project Management System, which will facilitate efficient project planning, tracking, collaboration, and reporting.
Provide an overview of the online project management system.
Explain the purpose of the SRS document and its intended audience.

Business Objectives:
Describe the goals and objectives of the online project management system.
Outline the business strategies and value proposition.

Scope:
The system will provide features for creating and managing projects, assigning tasks, tracking progress, managing resources, generating reports, and facilitating team communication.

Specify the scope of the online project management system.
Define the boundaries and limitations of the system.
Identify the target users (project managers, team members, stakeholders, etc.) and their roles.

Stakeholders:
List and describe the stakeholders involved in the online project management system, such as project managers, team members, clients, executives, etc.
Functional Requirements:

Identify and describe the functional requirements of the system, such as:
User registration and authentication
Project creation and management
Task and milestone management
Document and file sharing
Collaboration and communication features (discussions, notifications, etc.)
Time tracking and resource management
Reporting and analytics
Integration with third-party tools (if applicable)


Functional Requirements for the Online Project Management System:

User registration and authentication:
Users should be able to create accounts and register with the system.
Authentication mechanisms such as username/password or social media login should be provided for secure access.
User roles and permissions should be defined to control system access and privileges.

Project creation and management:
Users with appropriate permissions should be able to create new projects.
Projects should have attributes like a unique identifier, title, description, start and end dates, and associated team members.
Project details should be editable, and projects may be marked as active, on hold, or completed.

Task and milestone management:
Users should be able to create tasks and assign them to team members within a project.
Tasks should have attributes such as a unique identifier, title, description, due date, priority, and status (e.g., not started, in progress, completed).
Milestones should be set to track major achievements or deliverables within a project.

Document and file sharing:
Users should be able to upload and share project-related documents and files.
Version control should be implemented to manage document revisions.
Access control settings should be available to specify who can view, edit, or download files.

Collaboration and communication features:
Users should be able to engage in discussions or forums related to a project or specific tasks.
Real-time notifications or email alerts should be sent to relevant users for task assignments, updates, or important project-related events.

Time tracking and resource management:
Users should be able to log time spent on tasks or projects.
Resource allocation and scheduling features should be available to assign team members to tasks and track their availability.

Reporting and analytics:
The system should provide reporting capabilities, generating project progress reports, task status reports, and resource utilization reports.
Analytics features may include visualizations and metrics related to project timelines, task completion rates, and resource allocation.

Integration with third-party tools (if applicable):
The system should allow integration with external tools such as calendar applications, project management software, or document management systems.
APIs or plugins should be available for data exchange or synchronization with external systems.


Non-Functional Requirements:


Performance and scalability
Security and access control
Usability and user experience
Reliability and availability
Compatibility with different devices and browsers
Data backup and recovery
Compliance with relevant regulations (if applicable)
System Interfaces:

Identify and describe the external interfaces the system interacts with, such as:
Integration with popular project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello)
Email and notification systems
Document management systems (e.g., Google Drive, SharePoint)
APIs for third-party integrations (if applicable)

Constraints:
Highlight any constraints or limitations that may impact the system's design or implementation, such as budgetary constraints, technology limitations, or regulatory requirements.
Assumptions and Dependencies:

Specify any assumptions made during the requirements gathering process.
Identify any dependencies on external systems, resources, or third-party services.
Glossary:

Define the key terms and concepts used throughout the SRS document.

Entities:
